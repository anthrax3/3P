<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes, several definitions are available for a word. For instance, the word <code>ASSIGN</code> is an ABL <em>statement</em>, but is also a <em>method</em>. You can loop through the various definitions by holding the <code>CTRL</code> key and pressing the <code>DOWN</code> arrow key (also works with <code>UP</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In another case, you might want to keep the tooltip open when you move your mouse ; in order, for example, to click the <code>Go to definition</code> link of a procedure&#39;s tooltip. You might want to press the <code>CTRL</code> key to do just that</p>
</li>
</ul>
