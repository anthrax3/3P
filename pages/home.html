<h2 id="about-this-project">About this project</h2>
<p>The <strong>OpenEdge</strong> <strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>B</strong>usiness <strong>L</strong>anguage, or <a href="https://www.progress.com/openedge">OpenEdge ABL</a> (formerly known as <strong>Progress 4GL</strong>) is a fourth-generation programming language which uses an English-like syntax. Applications developped with this langage are portable across computing systems, it uses its own integrated relational database and programming tool which is called the &quot;appbuilder&quot;.</p>
<p>Progress Programmers Pal (3P), is a <strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" title="Notepad++ home page">notepad++</a></strong> plugin designed to help writing <strong>ABL code</strong>,  its use is governed by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL License</a>.</p>
<p>3P transforms notepad++ into an ABL code editor, providing :</p>
<ul>
<li>synthax checking</li>
<li>compilation</li>
<li>autocompletion</li>
<li>tooltips</li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not fond of the appbuilder and looking for a fast and efficient <strong>ABL editor</strong>, look no further!</p>

<h2 id="key-features">Key features</h2>
<p>This paragraph briefly presents the main features of 3P.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Ths plugin will display two new side panels (on left and right) as shown below :</p>

<h3 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax highlighting</h3>
<p>3P has an embedded syntax highligher, several themes are available and switchable at will :</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/3P/gh-pages/content_images/a84d092e-8d45-11e5-87c6-830d40460e14.png" alt="image"></p>
<h3 id="auto-completion">Auto-completion</h3>
<p>A key feature of 3P is the built in auto-completion window. Fully integrated with notepad++, it smoothes the developper work by suggesting the best match according to his intention :</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/3P/gh-pages/content_images/419a86a4-8d48-11e5-9155-c062659551dd.png" alt="image"></p>

<h3 id="tooltips">ToolTips</h3>
<p>Tooltips are another important part of 3P, they provide information on a word. You can activate them by simply hovering a word with your cursor :</p>

<h3 id="code-explorer">Code explorer</h3>
<p>The code explorer is your best friend when it comes to... exploring the code.</p>

<p><em>thanks captain!</em></p>

<p>It acts as an improved <code>function list</code>, well known to the notepad++ users. It displays the structure of the program and provides a quick way to jump from a code&#39;s portion to another (left click an item to get redirected to it) :</p>

<h2 id="a-final-word">A final word</h2>
<p>One thing the appbuilder has that 3P doesn&#39;t, is the <a href="https://documentation.progress.com/output/ua/OpenEdge_latest/index.html#page/gsstu/overview-of-the-openedge-appbuilder.html">graphical interface</a> to modify your .w files. You can do it by code, obviously, but i admit that it&#39;s not a simple task.</p>
<p>Personally, i use 3P as a <strong>complement</strong> to the app builder, designing interfaces with the graphical tool and switching to notepad++ to modify the core behavior.</p>
