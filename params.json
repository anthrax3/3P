Applications developped with this langage are portable across computing systems, it uses its own integrated relational database and programming tool which is called the \"appbuilder\".\r\n\r\nProgress Programmers Pal (3P), is a **[notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ \"Notepad++ home page\")** plugin designed to help writing **ABL code**,  its use is governed by [GPL License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\r\n\r\n3P transforms notepad++ into an ABL code editor, providing :\r\n\r\n* synthax checking\r\n* compilation\r\n* autocompletion\r\n* tooltips \r\n* and much more!\r\n\r\nIf you are not fond of the appbuilder and looking for a fast and efficient **ABL editor**, look no further!\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Quick start ##\r\n\r\n### Installation ###\r\n\r\nThere are two **very easy** ways of installing 3P :\r\n\r\n1. The first way is through the plugin manager, go to : \r\n    * `PLUGINS > PLUGIN MANAGER > SHOW PLUGIN MANAGER`\r\n    * Look for **3P** in the available plugins list and click on the checkbox\r\n    * Press install\r\n    * restart notepad++\r\n\r\n2. The second way is to install the plugin manually, which is also easy since it comes as a single .dll file\r\n    * Download the latest version of the file\r\n    * `SETTINGS > IMPORT > IMPORT PLUGIN(S)`\r\n    * Select the downloaded .dll file\r\n    * restart notepad++\r\n\r\n### First use ###\r\n\r\nOnce you installed the plugin you will be asked to restart notepad++ once again to activate the syntax highlighting, then you are ready to use 3P.\r\n\r\n> wiki incoming...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## 3P's showcase  ##\r\n\r\nThis paragraph briefly presents the main features of 3P.\r\n\r\n### Overview ###\r\n\r\nThs plugin will display two new side panels (on left and right) as shown below :\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11553075/11215041/8e342adc-8d44-11e5-9c3e-fef920076f46.png)\r\n\r\n### Syntax highlighting ###\r\n\r\n3P has an embedded syntax highligher, several themes are available and switchable on the fly :\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11553075/11215274/a84d092e-8d45-11e5-87c6-830d40460e14.png)\r\n\r\n### Autocompletion ###\r\n\r\nA key feature of 3P is the built in autocompletion window. Fully integrated with notepad++, it smoothes the developper work by suggesting the best match according to his intention :\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11553075/11215781/419a86a4-8d48-11e5-9155-c062659551dd.png)\r\n\r\n*[Learn more about this feature here](../master/wiki/autocompletion.md)*\r\n\r\n### ToolTips ###\r\n\r\nTooltips are another important part of 3P, they provide information on a word. You can activate them by simply hovering a word with your cursor : \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11553075/11218206/3b6b3e8e-8d54-11e5-8162-297dcb0f4c5c.png)\r\n\r\n*[Learn more about this feature here](../master/wiki/tooltips.md)*\r\n\r\n### Code explorer ###\r\n\r\nThe code explorer is your best friend when it comes to... exploring the code. \r\n\r\n> *thanks captain!*\r\n\r\nIt acts as an improved `function list`, well known to the notepad++ users. It displays the structure of the program and provides a quick way to jump from a code's portion to another (left click an item to get redirected to it) :\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11553075/11218752/256db7f8-8d57-11e5-9924-93fa3d87e83e.png)\r\n\r\n*[Learn more about this feature here](../master/wiki/code_explorer.md)*\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## A final word ##\r\n\r\nOne thing the appbuilder has that 3P doesn't, is the [graphical interface](https://documentation.progress.com/output/ua/OpenEdge_latest/index.html#page/gsstu/overview-of-the-openedge-appbuilder.html) to modify your .w files. You can do it by code, obviously, but i admit that it's not a simple task.\r\n\r\nPersonally, i use 3P as a **complement** to the app builder, designing interfaces with the graphical tool and switching to notepad++ to modify the core behavior.\r\n","google":"UA-70324648-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
