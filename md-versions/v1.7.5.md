## Prolint made easy! ##

Hello, long time no see! I had less time to spend on 3P lately but that doesn't mean the project is dead, far from it! I'm still planning to release a stable in a near future (that will include OOABL), please be patient :)
And without further ado, let's move on to the news...

**Prolint made easy!**

Analyzing your code with prolint is a very good idea, it can bring into light issues that you missed or allows you to clean up your source file by detecting unused variables (for instance).

That being said, before this version, you had to manually install/configure prolint. 3P would only provide an interface for Prolint. That's a thing of the past, Prolint can now be automatically downloaded and installed in your 3P configuration directory. Just press `F12`, click the download link and that's it : it works! Of course, if you want to set up your own rules and/or decide which one you want to ignore, you might have some configuration to do :)

I'm using my own forks of [Prolint](https://github.com/jcaillon/prolint) and [Proparse.net](https://github.com/jcaillon/proparse), 3P will check for new updates regularly.

Remark : The location of the StartProlint.p procedure has changed, it is now in the folder called __prolint__ and located in the 3P configuration directory. Your previous procedure is not lost, it is directly under the 3P configuration directory, so you can reuse parts of it for the new procedure if you want. When you are done, it is advised to delete the old and obsolete file.

**DataDigger and external tools**

Until now, external tools (such as datadigger) would be embedded within the .dll and extracted at run time. That was really inconvenient for me because i had to manually keep the embedded version up to date. From now on, since datadigger/prolint/proparse are hosted on github, they will all be downloaded directly from there. It ensures that you will always have the latest release and it means lighter 3P updates. However, this also means that offline users will no longer have datadigger automatically installed. No worries, installing a third party tool offline is as simple as downloading the release on github and extracting the content to the configuration directory. You will get all the necessary info if the downloader fails to install a tool for you.

**Improvements :**

- The option pages have been updated, no need to click the save button anymore. The option page called __Options > others__ has been merged with the __Options > misc__ page
- The menu __Misc__ is now called __Modification tag__ and regroups all the related functions :
  - You can now setup the template used for the __surround with modif tag__ and __add title block__ directly in the __Set > File info__ page which makes more sense
  - The template is now defined in a separate file (instead of being stored in the config.xml) which means this file can be shared with your team so you can all use the same modification tags
- New option in the update page, you can now configuration a proxy to use to check for updates
- Improved updater and added a setup dialog box after an install to modify notepad++ options such as : automatic backup, multi-selection and default auto-completion replacement
- Added keywords : `PROCESS-ARCHITECTURE` `PROCEDURE-COMPLETE` `Write`
- New options for the deployment :
  - You can now send files to a .cab file (works like zip rules)
  - Changed the behavior of the __display parser errors on save__, the notification now allows you to disable the feature for the current file only
  - Extended the possibilities of the deployer (CopyFolder, DeleteFolder)
  - You can now use the special variable `<ROOT>` which is always available and is replaced by the path to your source directory (without the ending '')
  - For the transfer rules and in particular, for the transfer target : it is now possible to use the | character to separate several target path (the file will then be copied to the different locations). This is equivalent to writing several rules with the "continue" option set to "yes", it is just a simpler way to write it

**Fixed issues :**

- #160, #161 : problems with prototype synchronization in include files
- #162 : no fields available on the autocompletion for buffers
- Problem with progress v9x : issue with the use of too many streams in the 3P progress program, v9 limits the max stream to 5 -> corrected to only use 1 stream...
- Fields display all the flags
- Change the behavior of the prototype update, it now occurs AFTER the file is saved, which is safer in case of a problem
- #163 : The code explorer now has again the button "from include" that allows to display/hide the items parsed from include files
- No longer automatically autocompletes simple numbers
- fixed compilation errors display issue that would occur if the error was located in an include file for instance
- #164 : Search window inactive when CRTL+F
- #165 : Incomplete procedure name when using preprocessed variables
- Fixed the critical bug with progress version inferior to 11.6 in the latest version of 3P
- Fix a problem occurring when the PROPATH used was too long

And as always, ENJOY!
