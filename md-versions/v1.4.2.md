## Custom shortcuts and QOL fixes ##

Key point of this release : you can now easily customize the keyboard shortcuts for 3P actions (like compile, go to definition and so on...). It doesn't use the native shortcut mapper of Notepad++ because I find the feature very clumsy. Instead, you get a new page in the options of 3P, it lets you override existing shortcuts of Npp and it is more user friendly.

**Improvements**
- The user can now easily customize its shortcuts through the option page
- Added `-ct 1` parameter for each database connection in order to speed up the detection of unavailable databases
- 3P no longer spams you if it can't connect to Github

**Corrected issues :**
-  no longer copies the content of the file into a temporary file before compiling/executing/checking the syntax of a .cls file, since the filename must match the class name. For other type of files, now only copies it if the file has unsaved modifications

Enjoy!
