## Transition to v1.4.0 ##

Now this is awkward, I released the version 1.4.0 but the users that have the version 1.3.1 or below will not get the automatic update if they have the `Get pre-releases` option checked...

This release is only here to correct this behavior.

You will get another update (the v1.4.0) right after installing this one!

Sorry for the inconvenience guys!
