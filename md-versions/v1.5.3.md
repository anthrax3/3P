## Bug corrections ##

2 releases in less than 48h... Pigs will have wings afterall.

Although this release packs a new feature, it really is more like a hotfix for the 1.5.2 :)

In 1.5.2, the mass compiler was compiling all the source files in a temporary folder, then moved everyone to the compilation folder (or near the sources if you checked that option). I did this for several reasons :
- first of all, when compiling a *.cls file, Progress generates the .r files for all the class files in the inherited class hierarchy and it also generates the sub directories corresponding to the package for each class -> so you either know in advance which files will be generated (but i don't since 3P doesn't parse class files yet) or you isolate the compiled files so you know for sure which *.r code were generated for each file (that's what i did)
- secondly, I actually thought that it would be faster to write to the local disk and then move the files to the distant (i.e. on a windows server for instance) folder -> I was wrong
- and... this list as only two items

The bottom line is that the fastest way to compile a bunch of files is to directly compile them in their respective destination folder. That's what the 1.5.3 does (however, you get the option to do it the old way).

Note to self : remember the **KISS** (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle for my future work on 3P...

**Improvements**
- New option in the mass compiler, export the report to an html file
- Added an option that let the user choose to always compile programs locally (in the temp folder) and move them to their destination only when the compilation is ok; otherwise it compiles a program directly in its destination folder

**Corrected issues :**
- Fix a bug introduced in 1.5.2 for prolint users
- Fixing performance issues in the mass compiler

Thank you for reading!
