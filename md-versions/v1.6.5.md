## Deploy your application (v2!) ##

**Notes :**

- The syntax themes have been improved (properties have been added), if you are using a custom file, don't forget to update it :)
- [The documentation on the deployment is available, please take a look!](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/#/deployment)

**Improvements :**

- The syntax themes have been improved, you can now set : 
  - The caret color
  - The line numbers style
  - The fold margin style
  - The smart highlighting style 
  - The brace highlighting style 
  - The bad brace highlighting style 
  - You can also define the font name to use for a particular item

**Corrected issues :**

- Correction of typos in the deploy application screen
