## New awesome features! ##

This version brings a lot of new exciting features, enjoy! 

**Improvements**

- The software should now feel even more responsive as several computation have been sent to background threads
- The code explorer now has an indicator (the refresh icon changes to clock) that allows the user to know when a file is being parsed
- Massive improvement of the file info page (like it was hard to do better than the existing page!?)
- Added a new option page **Others**, at the moment it will contain the options for the tags/title block templates
- New feature : **insert title block**, it uses the current file information to generate a title block at caret location, you can change the template in the option page _Others_
- Added a new option page **Shared/exported configuration**, it allows you to have even more control on the configuration of 3P and allows you to easily share certain files with your co-workers
- With a little configuration work, you can now **set up 3P to prolint** your files and have a direct visualization in Notepad++
- 3P can now handle a progress version **inferior to v11.0** (which was the minimum before this patch)
- If the propath contains relative path, they are computed based on the project local directory
- Added an option to completely hide the progress window in the taskbar when compiling/checking syntax (in options > general > don't use batch mode)
- The table tooltip now also displays for each field if it is mandatory or not
- Added the **Set compilation path** page, that allows the user to easily reroute the .r code compiled by 3P to a predefined path (see this page for more info)
