## Qol and UI improvements ##

Hello everyone,

No big feature for this release. Instead, I focused on smaller yet important details to make our Progress development even more enjoyable. 
Many long-due glitches or badly designed features got a rework and the user interface should be more intuitive or at least less annoying to use...

_Size doesn't mean everything_ once said a wise yordle. And he was probably right. The most attentive users will note that the plugin lost almost 1Mo for this release. 
Up until 1.5.4, I was using a 7z dll to unzip the release download on github (for the auto-update feature), I now have a pure C# function that does the same job for a few lines of code...

The next release will ship at least one new feature : you will be able to push to a distant FTP server your *.r code after a compilation.

See you soon,

And as always, ENJOY!

**Improvements**
- 3P can now be updated offline (i.e. w/o an internet connection) by copying the latest 3P.dll in the shared directory (set in `OPTIONS` > `Export/shared conf`)
- _Compilation path_ : Can now use wild card characters in the compilation path source pattern
- _Set environment_ : 
  - Various improvements on the user interface
  - Added the duplicate button, easier to find that the right click on the add button...
  - The compile in source/target directory button and compile with listing are now linked to the current environment instead of being global... Which makes a lot more sense
- _Options > Others_ : Modified the interface for an easier use
- The textbox component of the YamuiFramework (the user interface Framework of 3P) has been improved, it is now easier to modify long texts (when moving the carret left/right it doesn't jump to the next line like it did before...)
- Improved the directory selection interface (I admit that it was really bad..)
- Notifications (on the bottom right) no longer appear in the ALT+TAB menu
- Added a menu item **Switch environment** (CTRL+E by default)
- The currently selected environment is now displayed on the left panel and you can quickly show it / switch to another environment with new buttons
- You can set a shortcut to call for the main menu (default is F6)

**Corrected issues :**
- Fix a problem with textboxes stealing the scroll event from the page, preventing the using for scrolling when in a textbox
- Corrected an issue that caused 3P to display an error each time another instance of Npp was started
- Fixed a problem with he automatic update of shared conf
