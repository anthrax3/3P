## Second stable release! ##

Since the first **stable** release was published, you can choose to get the beta versions of 3P (hence get the new features before anyone else!) or stay in the stable branch and wait for a more _mature_ software.

This release allows the _non-beta_ users to catch up with the new features!

**Improvements**
- Fixed a bug in the shortcut settings page (+ added icons on each item)
- QOL in set environnement, left click on the explorer icon opens the file  notepad++, right click opens it in the windows explorer (same behavior as in the export page)
- Registered `NEXT` as a jump in code keyword (same as RUN or DYNAMIC-FUNCTION, applies a different color to those keywords to easily identify a _jump_ to another portion of code)

**Corrected issues :**
-  Corrected an issue where 3P would display multiple update notifications if Npp is not restarted when an update is available 

New awesome features incoming in the next release, **stay tuned**!
