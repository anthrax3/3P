## Mass compiler! ##

Do you have a large Progress application that you are compiling through the built-in **Application compiler**?

Does it take forever to compile and do you wish for a tool that could be doing it **much faster**?

Look no further, this release is made for you!

A new tool makes his way into 3P : the "mass compiler". Pretty self-explanatory, it allows you to compile entire source directories! It is different from the class application compiler because : 
- it uses a multi-processes compilation that makes it _[insert a 2 digit number that depends on your computer]_ times **faster**! 
- it uses the **compilation path** feature of 3P, allowing you to deploy your r-code wherever you want
- you can specify filters to include or exclude entire folders or files (uses the wildcards \* and ?)
- And last, but not least, you get a nice compilation report with all actions that were done, sorted and with clickable links to quickly correct your sources

You can find this new tool in the main window > Actions > Mass compiler.

Please make sure to create an issue on GitHub (or write me an email) if you find a bug!

**Improvements**
- Added .cls file extension in the file explorer (I've also reset the list of known extension for compilation and for the syntax highlighter)
- Compiling a program now resets the errors displayed for all its include files
- The notification informing you that current file is already being executed now allows you to kill the prowin process
- Small, but cool, improvements on the compilation...
- When compiling/running/checking the syntax of a file, now closes the previous notification concerning the file
- Now automatically closes certain notifications when an internal link is clicked
- Go to definition : now correctly asks the user to which definition he wants to be taken to when several definitions are found for a given word (this happens with a run persistent)

**Corrected issues :**
- Now immediately auto-cases the words that are completed with tab or enter instead of waiting for a next character.

As always, **enjoy!**
