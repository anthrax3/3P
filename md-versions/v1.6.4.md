## Deploy your application ##

**Notes :**
- Numerous menus have moved around, I've regrouped some of them in sub menus as I felt the main menu would become too crowed with the incoming features
- The file `_CompilationPath.conf` has been renamed in `_DeploymentRules.conf`, its format also changed! Please read the section about deploying your application for more info!

**Deploy your application :**

The goal of this feature is pretty straightforward : define a set of [rules](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/#/deployment-rules) and in one click on a button 3P can automatically :
- Compile all your progress files,
- Copy/move any file (including the generated *.r code) at will,
- Add them to progress libraries (.pl) or .zip files,
- Send them on a distant server over FTP

The rules are easy to set up but powerful enough to let you create the perfect package for your application.

See the [the deployment page](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/#/deployment) for more information about this feature!

_This feature replaces the now outdated mass compiler since it covers all its options_

**Improvements :**
- Added the progress Desktop / progress database administration shortcuts
- Added the real-only version of Datadigger (data reader), to make sure you don't accidentally wipe out the production database!
- Improved the HELP `F1` function, you now just have to position the caret on a word and press `F1` to see the help for this particular word (instead of selecting it previously)
- The updater nows displays the channel (beta/stable) you are using when informing that you have the latest release
- The parser was improved, there is a direct impact on the _generate code_ actions, it will check that 3P parsed your document correctly before doing anything, so it we are sure to insert the new code at the right position
- New option to deactivate the auto-update of function prototypes
- New option to automatically switch the encoding of a newly opened file (you can specify the encoding to use + the file filters for which this option applies) 
- New feature for exported configuration files : a configuration file is automatically imported when saved; also, whitespace visualisation is activated on those file (to help see tabs)

**Corrected issues :**
- Fixed an issue related to the display of errors : previously, if the document was containing an error and that you inserted lines above this error, when you save or switch the document, the error line would be duplicated. Well, no more!
- Fixed a problem with the progression bar of the mass compiler
- Fixed a problem with the function prototypes updater that would mess up the UIB BLOCK when inserting multiple prototypes at once
- Fixed a bug that would occur from different situation, when trying to compare a null object
- Fixed a bug in the tooltips, for procedures/functions, there was an error when the block was containing a label
- Fixed a problem with the function prototype update for function implementations ending with "." instead of ":"
- The parser should now correctly handle all types of function (including function define IN super/handle/porttype)
- Fixed a problem with the message windows, they would get above other windows (other than notepad++)
