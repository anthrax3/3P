## Visual improvements and fixed auto-case ##

New beta release with a lot of hidden changes, mainly concerning the UI Framework (yes this has been my main concern lately!).

I have a few more tweaks to do in it before moving on to more _important_ features (or should I just say _new features_ :p).

Before letting you read the patch note, I'd like to add that the new themes were done a bit in a rush but I'll work on that detail for the stable release because you can only truly enjoy an IDE when you have found a theme that suits your style... Right?

**Improvements :**
- **new application themes!**
- new syntax highlighting themes (but to be honest it took me 20s to make them and they are pretty bad... -> i'll improve them for the stable release) 
- improved style/theme system, you can use aliases to other fields to avoid repeating the same color, you can even use 2 functions to modify a given a color : darken/lighten 
- Better auto-case mode :
  - first the current mode (upper/lower/camel) has been splitted into 2 options : one for the keywords, the other for the database information (like table name, fields...)
  - for each options you now get a 4th mode which is the _natural_ mode, it auto-case the keyword like it is defined in the database (for table, fields..) or like in the documentation for keywords (for instance, if a method is in lowercase in the documentation then it will be cased to lower) : **this is the new default mode** as it makes much more sense afterall...
- Improved the YamuiFramework by A LOT
- Added the missing keyword `STARTING` to the lexer
- Now gives the focus to scintilla (the editor component) at start up
- Now warns the user when executing a program hidden by a *.r file in the same directory
- The autocompletion now displays the database/tables/fields/sequences of the current environment and empty them if there are none (previously it would display the info of the last environment selected that had database info)

**Corrected issues :**
- fixed a bug that changed the color of the text selected outside of Progress files

The next release will be on the stable branch if no bugs are discovered during the next few days.

As always, ENJOY!
