Hello everyone,

A new stable release for 3P, I think you will be satisfied with the overall robustness of this version, It took more time than for previous versions to build it but I'm confident I won't get much bugs on this one (fingers crossed).

For the beta users, not much happened since the last release (3 days ago :p). However, if you updated from the v1.6.1, I encourage you to read the patch notes to learn more about the features described in the release title!

I've also updated the web site, [go take a look!](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/)

And as always... **enjoy**!

**Improvements :**
- New menu : deploy curent file (allows you to deploy non progress file using step 1 deployment rules)
- 2 new application themes
