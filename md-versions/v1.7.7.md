## New stable release! ##

Hello everyone,

Here is a second stable release in the 1.7.x version; it ships a ton of new features for v1.7.0 users and bug fixes the latest beta users.

I was hoping that this stable release would be the 1.8.0 and would contain the OOP parser I promised a long time ago. Unfortunately I had less time to work on the project this year. However, I'm not giving up on it; you can check what is planned in v1.8.x on the github :)

In the meantime, I hope you will enjoy this version!

**Fixed issues :**

- #185 : Remove the custom syntax highlight checkbox from the options page
- #181 : open the files in the propath on "Go to definition"
- #186 : Parsing problem with preprocessed variables like `{&_proparse_ prolint-nowarn(noundo)}`
- #171 : indentation problem caused by the parser
- #190 : Define parameter buffer not handled correctly
- #191 : Wrong analysis of temp-table indexes

**Notes regarding cutom syntax themes :**

Due to numerous changes of the syntax highlight feature, the custom colors configuration file has changed a bit. The conf file is in `%notepadplugins%\config\3P\Themes\_ThemesForSyntax.conf`. If you had a custom one, rename it. Then go to Options > Share Export config > click the export button for the syntax highlighting theme. You can then compare the default file to yours and put back your modifications.
