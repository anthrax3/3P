## Fixing compilation errors ##

A small release in the stable branch, it corrects a problem of compilation introduced in patch 1.5. Moreover, 3P should now correctly compile class definition (.cls) files.

I'm also using this release to reset the list of file extensions handled by 3P. Early users would not have .cls files in this list and could not compile class definition files without changing the options.

I've also added a more detailed documentation on the **Set environment** page, [click here](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/#/set_environment). It contains core settings for 3P to work at its full potential but its configuration is probably not be crystal clear for every users.

**Improvements**
- Added an option to let the user chose whether or not he wants to generate the .lst (debug-list) file during the compilation

**Corrected issues :**
- Fixed an issue that would cause a compilation error every time you try to compile something if the path to your temp folder contains a space
- Fixed a small issue with the autocompletion GUI, it was not pixel perfect
- Fixed an issue that would cause the check syntax command to fail if you have a .r file next to your source file
- Fixed the compilation for class files
