## Nothing new, but everything is better ##

After all the emotions brought by the v1.2, let's chill out a bit and enjoy a small release that brings... Well... basically nothing new. The code explorer was the second feature I developed for 3P (the first being the auto-completion); and to be honest, when it was functional enough for me to use it my progress developments, I put it on background and kind of forgot about it. However, as of v1.2, it wasn't working as I wanted it to be; so something had to be done. This improvement also impacts the auto-completion list and the file explorer, everything should feel even more responsive and overall faster.

_A tons of new features_ are coming on the next release so... stay tuned!

**Improvements**

- improved the way label sizes are calculated (impacts tooltips and message boxes)
- Revamped the code explorer list; as usual, the main changes are behind the curtains; However, it should feel more responsive and will not cause small _lags_ when the document is being parsed. It also corrects small filtering bugs and correctly retains the expanded categories across all files
- Added the option to deactivate the 'show spaces' option toggled on by 3P on Npp's startup

**Corrected issues :**

- fixed an issue with the auto-completion; buffers for temp-tables now correctly display the list of the fields associated to the temp-table when pressing dot '.' after the name of the buffer
- The file explorer now correctly applies the filter after changing the directory or refreshing
