## Closing issues by the dozen ##

3P is available through the plugin manager of notepad++! (Actually, it is since September ^^")

**Improvements :**

- The YAMUI framework I'm developing and using for 3P has been considerably improved, below is a non exhaustive list of the changes : 
  - The behavior of scroll bars is now equal to the classic scroll bar of windows (a click on the bar will scroll to this position)
  - Windows can now be re-sized as you would do for normal windows (i.e. grad an edge and pull)
- New feature for deployment rules : If you wish, you can now use regular expression in the `source pattern`. If you do so, you can then use capturing groups and use $1, $2... in the `deploy target` to dynamically rename the `deploy target` in function of the source. To activate this feature, the "source pattern" and "deploy target" should start with the character `:`
- Better parsing for include files, now takes into account include parameters
- Improved the lexer to tokenize correctly WORDS split (possibly on multiple lines) by a `~` (i.e. ~DE~FINE~ is actually compilable in progress...)
- #81 : The parser now fully handles preprocessed name (i.e. {&name} or {x}) and replaces them by their value
- #81 : Improved the parser to take into account path for include directives (i.e. {path/dir/file.i})
- #119 : Improved parser to get the initial value and format of each field for temp-tables

**Fixed issues :**

- #82 : empty shortcuts were not correctly saved
- Fixed the problem when requesting the github API causing the update check to fail
- Fixed an issue that could occur when you an update of prototypes in your document is done (on save for instance) and that would make n++ freeze
- The input dialog boxes now correctly handle the escape key as well as the enter key
- #140 : The parser now correctly handles `ON *` event
- #107 : Now correctly parses temp-table indexes
- #104 : Cleaned up keywords list
- #90 : deleting a function now immediately deletes its prototype (if any)
- #134 : Now displays a `RUN "myproc".` and `PROCEDURE "myproc":` in the code explorer as expected
- #136 : Fixed the auto completion system to act only when the auto completion pop up is activated
- #114 : procedures are now correctly deleted even when not surrounded by an appbuilder block
- #80 & #87 : Instead of file extensions, you will now set a list of patterns that identify a Progress file (for instance : `*.p,*.i,*.w,*.t,*.d,*.lst,*.df,*.cls`)
- #83 : correctly restore the caret line/ selection colors according to npp current theme
- #99 : You can now use the escape key on notification pop up to close them
