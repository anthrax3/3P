## The first stable release of 3P! ##

After 7 months of hard work, it is finally time for 3P to get its first **stable release**, oh yeah!

You now have the choice to either participate to the beta versions, or just enjoy the software in a more stable state. Since you installed 3P in its early state, the option to participate to the beta tests is checked by default. You can turn it off by going to `OPTIONS` > `UPDATES` and uncheck `I want to get beta releases`.

I also invite you to check the [official website](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/), I've updated some pages to help the users understand how they can get the most of 3P.

Thanks you for using 3P, a huge thanks to those who wrote **feedbacks and issues** : this is helping **A LOT** and it keeps me motivated!
