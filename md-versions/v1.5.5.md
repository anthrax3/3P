## Database connection fix ##

Yesterday's release (1.5.4) introduced a bug on the database connection occurring if you are using the _parameter file_ list in the `SET ENVIRONMENT` page.

Thank you to the beta users that reported the issue :)

**Corrected issues :**
- Fixed a bug that caused the *.pf file of your environment to be ignored when executing a Progress action (compile/run/and so on...)
- Fixed a minor bug reported by beta users

Sorry for the inconvenience!!
