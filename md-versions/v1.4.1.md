## Craft your own themes! ##

Hello everyone, 

A rather small release but with a feature that was requested **A LOT** : more themes and the ability the easily create custom ones!

Go check out [this link](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/#/custom-themes) to learn how to customize your Pal.

**Improvements**
- Added a visible option in `OPTIONS > MISC` to limit the amount of time given to 3P to list the files in your directory (in the file explorer)
- Added an option in `OPTIONS > COLOR SCHEMES` to allow the use of a custom **U**ser **D**efined **L**anguage
- Support for single line comments and hexadecimal numbers (issue #67) 
- Added new keywords introduced since the version 11.0 of progress
- New syntax highlighting and application themes
- The user can now create and modify syntax highlighting and application themes through config files (available in OPTIONS > EXPORT / SHARE CONFIG)
- The option _Show spaces_ now only applies to progress files, instead of being applied for every files opened with notepad++

**Corrected issues :**
-  fixed an issue with the _save everything_ button in the option pages, that would only save numeric fields and not string based fields
-  The update button in the `OPTIONS > UPDATE` page now correctly does the job in a background thread
- Now correctly warn the user if a procedure/function exceeds the appbuilder characters limitation

Enjoy!
