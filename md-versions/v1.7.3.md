## File and code explorer improvements ##

A quick release to test out the latest features.

The website has been updated! You can download the x64 version there : [http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/)

Enjoy!

**Improvements :**
- The main menu is now displayed as a tree view, no more cascading windows; you can also use a filter to quickly find the command you want to execute
- The parser now recognizes the keywords `SUBSCRIBE` `UNSUBSCRIBE` and `PUBLISH`, the statements are displayed on the code explorer (fixes #6)
- The `EXTERNAL` procedures are now put in a different section that standard procedure definition in the code explorer; the dll name associated is also displayed (fixes #5)
- New sections in the code explorer for each type of `RUN` statement; i.e. either run an internal routine or an external .p
- New sections in the code explorer for each type of function call; i.e. it can be either static `myfunc()`, dynamic but internal `DYNAMIC-FUNCTION('myfunc')`, or dynamic and external (fixes #31)
- You can now see the temp tables defined in your file directly in the code explorer (fixes #40)
- The file explorer now displays the file of the local base path as a tree view (fixes #73); the tree view for the other modes (compilation/propath/everywhere) will come in the next version

**Fixed issues :**
- #147 : Panels not applying their previous state on start
