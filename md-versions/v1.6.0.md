## Stable release - tons of new stuff ##

More than one month since the last stable release, a lot happened in the beta branch of 3P!

Make sure to browse the whole release log if you want to be able to use this software to its maximum potential =)

Don't hesitate to create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jcaillon/3P/issues) / send me an email if there is something bothering you in 3P or if you would like to see a new features (however small / big it may be! I'm totally opened to new suggestions).

**Improvements :**

- 2 new application themes, learn how to modify and create themes [here](http://jcaillon.github.io/3P/#/custom-themes), it's super easy! **N.b. : the config files for the themes were renamed in v1.6.0 to avoid any conflicts with old version**
- 2 new syntax highlighting themes!
- now remembers the current _view mode_ of the file explorer between each session
- the files list in the file explorer is now updated at each change of environment
- the file explorer displays a clock when listing the file (like the code explorer when the document is being parsed)
- the current environment is selected by default in the _switch environment_ menu

**Corrected issues :**

- correctly refreshed the file explorer and the code explorer when showing them for the first time
- closing a question box (for instance in the set environment when confirming to delete an object), will now correctly not continue the action
- In the set shortcuts page, the items are now sorted alphabetically, fixes #71 

**Enjoy!**
