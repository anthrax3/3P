## Auto-completion hotfix ##

Hi,

Quick fix for a problem that appeared in the last version, sorry for the inconvenience! I'm also shipping the latest improvement while I'm at it.

And don't forget to report that kind of bug when you see, I can't find them all by myself :)

**You are using the compilation path feature** : It has been improved and now lets you either multiple copy of the compiled files before moving them to their respective final destinations. This means that your current compilation path file has to be updated (it will appear empty for 3P otherwise), [see the instructions here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/3P/beta/3PA/Data/CompilationPath) (basically you just have to add Copy or Move on the 4th column!

**Improvements :**
- Improved compilation path (will later be renamed into compilation transfer) : Post compilation, you can now chose to copy the files with a given input path pattern into any directory and as many times as you wish. You can also choose to simply move them to a targeted directory (this is the current feature)

**Corrected issues :**
- Fixed an issue that was preventing the auto-completion of FIELDS to show up
