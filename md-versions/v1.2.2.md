## Small bug fix ##

A quick release to fix small bugs encountered by some users. Hopefully, this should decrease the amount of skulls in your bottom-right corner!
The major correction concerns the **automatic updater** that wasn't **automatic** for all of you... This was **your last manual update**, sorry for the inconvenience!

**Corrected issues :**
- Finally fixed the 3P updater! It WILL work as expected during the next update!
- Corrected a recurrent Thread error that would occur for some users when the notepad++ window where hidden/shown
- Corrected an out of range error occurring in the file explorer
