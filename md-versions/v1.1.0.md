## First release ##

**New features**
- You can now choose to compile your code in the same folder as the source
- You can now set extra command line parameters for the compile/check syntax/run actions
- New **options** window to edit the application settings from a user interface 
- You can now surround a piece of code with a modification tag
- #26 : now display the owner block of a run/function call in the code explorer
- User Defined Lang : the embedded syntax highlighting definition now only updates on software updates and the user can completely deactivate its update (too much update in this sentence!)
- Adding a disclaimer in the about page

**Improvements :**
- The ABL lexer now reads character-string descriptor (i.e. `"characters" [ : [ R | L | C | T ] [ U ] [ max-length ] ]`) as a whole and created a special token instead of creating symbol+word tokens
- now prevents spam of 3P features
- The toggle comment feature now works differently :
  - if there is not selection, toggle on/off the current line
  - if there is a selection, toggle on/off the selected BLOCK
  - Now also works for multiple selections
- Improved notifications, they are now displayed on the same screen of Npp's window

**Corrected issues :**
- #12 : added a vertical scroll to tool-tips when the content is too important
- #8 : Now takes into account character-string as well as keywords for event-list and widget-list
- #13 : Tool-tips are not activated when the mouse hovers a comment section
- #10 : Creating a new file and saving as progress file now correctly allows the user to execute 3P features
- #20 : now reads a keyword if split on several lines by a ~
- #18 : now correctly detects a new procedure if defined with the abbreviation "PROCE" 
- #17 : Closing the "File Explorer" panel when un-docked now updates the toolbar button status
- #11 : A "private" flag is now shown in the code explorer for private procedures
- #10 : now correctly identifies new files saved with a progress .ext as progress files
- #4 : typo on tool-tip fixed
- #7 : changed file explorer icon to differentiate it easily with the code explorer
- #23 : Improved behavior for multiple screen, now always searching on which screen Npp is displayed before showing a notif, auto-completion and so on...
- Fix several minor bugs (from the auto generated report)
- Fixed lexer to correctly read end of statement again (was broken at the last commit)
- Corrected issues : #32, #29, #33, #27, #36, #35, #32,
- Now correctly handles errors if 3P failed to write in userDefineLang.xml (which would cause 3P to fail loading)
- #41 : adding support for the key word EDITING (code folding + correct block indentation
- #39 : you can now open the main application window from any file (instead of only progress files before)
- missing keyword : "FILE-INFO" as an abbreviation of "FILE-INFORMATION"
- Corrected a bug that caused the plugin to be enable to run normally when the user modified a file from an external editor and then reloaded it in npp
