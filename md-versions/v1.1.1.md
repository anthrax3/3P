## new beta version ##

_This version is poor in content and only aims to correct a critical bug that would force the user to restart notepad++ before continuing working normally; More stuff incoming after the holidays!_

**Improvements**

- Fixing typos in tooltips and messages
- Modifying the version format, it is now : MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION, the last digit in the assembly revision indicates if the build is a (0) stable release or (1) pre-release

**Corrected issues :**
- Error that prevented the user from compiling a file if it wasn't from the appbuilder!
- Corrected a stackoverflow exception in the parser
- Error when computing the scope of a given line, causing certain user variables to not immediately show up in the auto-completion list
- #42, #46 : Npp freezing or code explorer list not displayed when manipulating the dockable dialog
- #43 : several CTRL+Q on empty lines now correctly handle comment/uncomment

### happy holidays!
