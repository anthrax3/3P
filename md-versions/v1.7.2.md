## 64bit version and new list engine ##

3P is now available for the x64 version of notepad++! I'll update the website soon to include this new version. Meanwhile, you can get it on the [GITHUB release page](https://github.com/jcaillon/3P/releases).

However... very few notepad plugins have been released for the 64-bits version. The plugin manager itself is still only available for the 32-bits version! If you are using another plugin than 3P, you might want to hang on to the 32-bits version for a while :)

This release brings a lot of changes, particularly to the auto-completion. I needed to make the class a lot more flexible (and make the control faster) to be able to implement the next big features (sorry, no spoilers!). That's where **you are very important** : I need you to report any bugs you might find! As a beta user, you represent a whooping **2%** of all the 3P users; 98% are using the stable v1.7.0 version (yes, i can do maths) -> that's not a lot people to find issues early :)

Anyway... As always : ENJOY!

**Improvements :**

- The auto-completion system has been almost entirely revamped : 
  - It now uses the YamuiFramework list which should be faster than the (previous control) objectlistview
  - You can now resize the auto-completion popup like you would resize any window (the size will be saved for your next session)
  - You can use Page down/up as well as the end/home key while the auto-completion is opened to quickly browse it
  - The category buttons can now pile up in a child popup accessible by clicking the _more_ button (tree blue dots) allowing to reduce the width of the auto-completion
  - The _auto-case_ feature is now part of the auto-completion, if you change the case mode for keywords or database items the modification will immediatly be visible in the auto-completion where said items will have the chosen case
- Deep changes to the file explorer and code explorer as well, they also use the new YamuiList control which will allow me to further extend their features (for instance have tooltip on those lists and display the file explorer as a tree)
- The code explorer now has a new section _current scope_ which allows you to quickly locate where you are in the file

**Fixed issues :**

- #146 : Error in the parser would cause npp to freeze under special circumstances
- #145 : Lexer failed for unix EOL
- #143 : autocompletion auto lowercase feature broken
