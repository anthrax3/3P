## Tracking down those nasty bugs ##

A small release to fix the bugs I've seen so far in v1.6.x. Hopefully, this version will be stable enough to allow me to work on the beta branch!

I'm counting on you to warn me if you encounter a bug in the stable branch, I can't see them all :)

**Improvements :**

- The HELP option in a DEFINE TEMP-TABLE statement is now used for the field description
- you can now use CTRL+Middle click to go back to the previous jump point (Go to definition) 
- you can now clear a shortcut in the options (fixes #74)
- new syntax highlitghting theme

**Corrected issues :**

- fixed a problem with the library loader of 3P that would cause incompatibilities with other plugins
- fixed problems with selection / caret line colors in non Progress files that were incorrectly reset
- fixed a problem with the _show all characters_ option that was not acting normally when switching between Progress/non progress files
- fixed a problem with the environment selection after an import of the list of environments from the shared folder
- fixed a problem with the MessageBox background displaying the theme image, which decreases the readability of the message
- the colors are now correctly applied to the code explorer at startup
- fixed problems with the split view : 
  - the default auto-completion (of notepad++) is now correctly blocked on both views for progress files
  - the tooltips are now functional on both views
  - FYI, I'm aware that the second view isn't instantly refresh (the syntax color only refreshes when the view is selected) but I still need to find a way to make this work correctly...
