All 3P's features are accessible from this menu, this is the main entry point. Once you are familiar with the software, you can use the direct shortcuts.

## Setting an environment ##

3P has a lot of features that are available immediately, like the auto-completion or the syntax highlighting. **However,** if you want to enable the **FULL POTENTIAL** of this software, like :
