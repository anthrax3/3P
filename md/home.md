## About this project ##

The **OpenEdge** **A**dvanced **B**usiness **L**anguage, or [OpenEdge ABL](https://www.progress.com/openedge) (formerly known as **Progress 4GL**) is a fourth-generation programming language which uses an English-like syntax. Applications developed with this language are portable across computing systems, it uses its own integrated relational database and programming tool which is called the "appbuilder".

Progress Programmers Pal (3P), is a **[notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++ home page")** plug-in designed to help writing **ABL code**,  its use is governed by [GPL License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

3P transforms notepad++ into an ABL code editor, providing :

* syntax checking
* compilation
* auto-completion
* tool-tips
* and much more!

If you are not fond of the appbuilder and looking for a fast and efficient **ABL editor**, look no further!

## Key features  ##

This paragraph briefly presents the main features of 3P.

### Overview ###

The screenshot below gives you a quick overview of 3P's features :

### Syntax highlighting ###

3P has an embedded syntax highlighter, several themes are available and switchable at will :

### Auto-completion ###

A key feature of 3P is the built in auto-completion window. Fully integrated with notepad++, it smooths the developer work by suggesting the best match according to his intention :

### Tool-Tips ###

Tool-tips are another important part of 3P, they provide information on a word. You can activate them by simply hovering a word with your cursor :

### Code explorer ###

The code explorer is your best friend when it comes to... exploring the code.

> *thanks captain!*

It acts as an improved `function list`, well known to the notepad++ users. It displays the structure of the program and provides a quick way to jump from a code's portion to another (left click an item to get redirected to it) :

## A final word ##

One thing the AppBuilder has that 3P doesn't, is the [graphical interface](https://documentation.progress.com/output/ua/OpenEdge_latest/index.html#page/gsstu/overview-of-the-openedge-appbuilder.html) to modify your .w files. You can do it by code, obviously, but i admit that it's not a simple task.

Personally, i use 3P as a **complement** to the AppBuilder, designing interfaces with the graphical tool and switching to notepad++ to modify the core behavior.
