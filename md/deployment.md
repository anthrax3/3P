**WORK IN PROGRESS, THIS IS NOT THE FINAL DOCUMENTATION**


## Goal ##

The goal of this feature is pretty straightforward : define a set of [rules](http://localhost/3P-pages/#/deployment-rules) and in one click on a button 3P will automatically :

- Compile all your progress files,
- Copy/move the any file (includig the generated *.r code) at will,
- Add them to progress libraries (.pl) or .zip files,
- Send them on a distant server over FTP

The rules are easy to set up but powerful enough to let you create the perfect package for your application.
