*Last update of this page : 23/03/2016*

Two topics are discussed here:

- creating / modifying a syntax highlighting theme
- creating / modifying an application theme

## Syntax themes ##

This kind of theme only concerns the part of notepad++ where the text is edited:

You can the foreground/background color and font weight of any type of keywords displayed in your progress files.

By default, you can only select through a limited amount of options in the `OPTIONS` > `COLOR SCHEMES` page of the application, as shown below :

To be able to define your own themes, you first need to **EXPORT** the internal list of themes into an external file that you will be able to edit.

For that, go to the `OPTIONS` > `SHARE/EXPORT CONFIG` page:

You can open the file in Notepad++ by clicking left on the open button ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/3P/gh-pages/content_images/0e75380e-f144-11e5-98c0-b8015017ff69.png).

## Application themes ##

The application themes define the colors of every interfaces of 3P. This includes the main application, the auto-completion, the file explorer, the code explorer, the tool-tips, the notifications and so on...

Follow the same procedure as for the syntax themes to define your own colors. You have to export the line **Application themes list** instead of the **Syntax highlighting themes list**:
