**3P** comes as a notepad++ plug-in, hence the first step is to download and install the latest version notepad++ at [notepad-plus-plus.org/download/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/).

Once notepad++ is installed, there are two **very easy** ways of installing 3P :

1. ~~The first way is through the plug-in manager, go to :~~
    * ~~`PLUGINS > PLUGIN MANAGER > SHOW PLUGIN MANAGER`~~
    * ~~Look for **3P** in the available list of plug-ins and click on the check box~~
    * ~~Press install~~
    * ~~restart notepad++~~
**THE METHOD ABOVE ISN'T AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT**

2. The second way is to install the plug-in manually, which is also easy since it comes as a single .dll file
    * Download the latest version of 3P (download button available on the menu on your right)
    * Stop notepad++
    * Go to your notepad++ installation folder, you should see a `/plugins/` folder
    * Unzip the content of the downloaded package into the aforementioned folder : `/plugins/3P.dll`
    * restart notepad++
