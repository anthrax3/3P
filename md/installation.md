**3P** is a notepad++ plug-in, hence the first step is to download and install the latest version notepad++ at :
[notepad-plus-plus.org/download/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/).

**Once notepad++ is installed :**

* Stop notepad++
* Download the [latest version](https://github.com/jcaillon/3P/releases/latest) of 3P (direct download button available on the menu on your right)
* Go to your notepad++ installation folder (usually %programfiles%\Notepad++), you should see a `/plugins/` folder
* Unzip the content of the downloaded package into the aforementioned folder (`/plugins/3P.dll` should now exist)
* restart notepad++
